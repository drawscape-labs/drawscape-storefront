Definiation of Drawscape API is in the api.yaml file.

If we are needing to use the Drawscape API from inside a component rendered in the browser
Please use this library `lib/drawscapeApi.ts`

If we need to make calls to the drawscape api from our server side code ie loader() and action() functions. 
Please use the `lib/drawscapeServerapi.ts` library
