# Verification Prompt

Please review the current branch and report ONLY the problems you find. 
Compare the code written on this branch to the current task and plan that we are trying to implement.

Organize issues by severity:
**Critical** – Must-fix items that will break the build, cause runtime errors, or invalidate the plan.
**High** – Serious flaws that could lead to incorrect behavior or major rework if left unfixed.
**Medium** – Important but non-blocking problems (e.g., edge-case bugs, violations of conventions).

Guidelines:
Do not list things that are already correct.
Ignore “Migration not staged” warnings.
Ignore files being is still untracked or unstages as critical issues
No code changes—just the verification report.
Format the response as four clearly labeled bullet lists: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
