## Feature Planning Workflow

When you ask me to create a plan (e.g. by typing **/plan**), I will follow this process:

1. **Clarify Requirements**
   • I'll behave like a senior software engineer, reviewing the feature or task you describe.
   • If anything is ambiguous or missing, I'll ask targeted follow-up questions. Simple tasks may skip this step.

2. **Draft the Plan**
   • Once I understand the goal, I'll create a new Markdown file inside the `tasks/` directory.
   • The file will contain an easy-to-read outline of the proposed solution:
     – High-level steps and architecture
     – Key data structures / modules (pseudocode only)
     – Minimal Markdown formatting for readability
   • No production code will be written at this stage.

3. **Review & Confirm**
   • You review the plan and either request changes or approve it.

4. **Initialize Implementation (after approval)**
Once I approve the plan by saying "approved"
   • Create and check out a new git branch with a descriptive name for the feature.
   • Commit the new task file with a message like "chore: initial plan for <feature>".
   • Actual implementation begins only when you explicitly instruct me to proceed.

Keep this workflow in mind whenever you request a project plan.
